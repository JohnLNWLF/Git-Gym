Weekly exercises to learn Git step by step

Welcome to **Git Gym**, the place where we flex our Git and GitHub muscles until the repos burst.

## ðŸ’¡ What's this?

This repository contains weekly exercises to become a Git version control ninja master. If you know what `git status` is, but not `git rebase`, this is your dojo.

## ðŸ”¥ Who's it for?

- Complete beginners who want to learn Git from scratch.
- Self-taught warriors who get lost in branches.
- Cool people who want to collaborate and grow their projects.

## ðŸ“… Structure

Each folder is a **weekly challenge**. Inside you'll find:
- A README for the challenge
- Step-by-step instructions
- Objectives
- Suggested solution (don't cheat!)
